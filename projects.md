			<h2>Field of study</h2>
		</header>
		<p>All of my projects are inspired by healthcare problems and are designed to help the diagnose and monitoring of different conditions in different areas, such as cardiology, radiology and production of healthcare equipment. Other projects showed are basic generic projects that can be modified and reused for more complex solutions and are destined to assure fast prototiping for other problems and projects.</p>

					<h3>Chest X-ray classification</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Using a convolutional neural network to classify 4 chest X-ray conditions of the dataset "COVID-19 Radiography Database" from Kaggle, The dataset was trained using different configurations of Resnet-50 and A CNN made from scratch and achieved an acuracy above 90%.</p>

					<h3>ECG signal classification</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project is my final paper at college and utilizes a convolutional neural network 1D made from scratch to classify different timeseries (ECG raw signal from "PTB-XL" database) between 5 categories, achieving a performace of 84% of accuracy and 81% off recall along different architectures, such as Resnet-50 and ensemble models trained with the same method.</p>

			<h2>Personal Summary</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I'm a Biomedical engineering undergraduate student at UNISINOS. I have 2 years of experience in research at the Startup Biosens Tech, working with manufacturing processses of microfluidic channels of rapid tests for several conditions and a data science project for inspection of production materials. Academically I have projects in the biomedical image and signal processing and many small projects that can be used as basic generic models for diverse problems for fast prototiping and testing.</p>
