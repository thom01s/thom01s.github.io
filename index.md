I'm a Biomedical engineering undergraduate student at UNISINOS. I have 2 years of experience in research at the Startup Biosens Tech, working with manufacturing processses of microfluidic channels of rapid tests for several conditions and a data science project for inspection of production materials. Academically I have projects in the biomedical image and signal processing and many small projects that can be used as basic generic models for diverse problems for fast prototiping and testing.
