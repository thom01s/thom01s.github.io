## Professional experience
I am currently a researcher at Biosens Tech, a startup that is developing rapid tests based on biossensors for diferent conditions, such as helping blood coagulation disorders diagnose and monitoring. I am responsible for the production of electrical sensitive test strips based on graphene, production of inputs for biossensor production, quality control of biossensors fisical measures, production documentation, search of production suppliers and training.

Recently the field of data science, I've develop a neural network based algorithm for biossensor non-conformity visual inspection. That uses the Inception V3 architecture to classify different test strips in 5 classes, one for each error and one for test strips that are in good condition. The model trained with more than 5000 images had a accuracy of 96% in the validation dataset and in a test with 16 images it droped to 88%, resulting 14 images correct and 2 images classified incorrectly. Although the model had a lower performance in a production simulation, every test strip with good condition was classified correctly and none of the improper test strips was classified in a good condition, meaning that the production didn't suffer from a significant impact. Currently, the model deployment is in study to research the usability in production.
